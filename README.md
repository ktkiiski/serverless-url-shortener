# Serverless URL shortener

Quickly set up your private URL shortener for your custom domain!
The app is completely hosted on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).
It is implemented with a low-cost "serverless" architecture.

You can quickly deploy your own URL shortener with a single command! See the instructions below!

The implementation is based on [the solution described in a blog by Stephan Hadinger](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/build-a-serverless-private-url-shortener/).

The app is orchestrated with Amazon CloudFormation, composed by the [Serverless utility](https://serverless.com/). It utilizes the following web components:

- **Amazon CloudFormation**: controls the orchestration of all the other services
- **Amazon S3**: hosts the resources for redirection URLs
- **Amazon Lambda**: executes the code for API calls, managing the resources on S3
- **Amazon API Gateway**: forwards the API HTTP requests for Amazon Lambda for execution
- **Amazon CloudFront**: acts as a front end for the API gateway and S3 buckets
- **Amazon Certificate Manager**: provides the certificates for secure connections to your custom domain
- **Amazon Route 53**: DNS management for your custom domain

## Prerequisities

### Set up AWS credentials

You need to [set up AWS credentials for your development environment](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/).

### Create a Hosted Zone

NOTE: You need to [create a Hosted Zone for Amazon Route53](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html#root-domain-walkthrough-switch-to-route53-as-dnsprovider) first for your custom domain first! Also, if you are using other domain name provider, such as GoDaddy, then you need to set up the DNS records for your domain.

## Setup

Edit the following attributes in the [`service.json`](./service.json) according to your custom domain:

- `name`: A distinct name of your app. Recommended to be in lower case and separate words with dashes. This will become the name of the service in the Serverless configuration and it will be used in Amazon resource names.
- `hostedZone`: This must be the apex (bare) domain matching the Hosted zone on your AWS Route53.

You also need to install the node packages to your local development environment:

    npm install

## Deployment

Deploy the development version:

    npm run deploy:dev

Deploy the production version:

    npm run deploy:prod

**IMPORTANT:** When deploying for the first time, you will receive email for confirming the certificate for the domain names!
The deployment continues only after you approve the certificate!
